# Object-Oriented-Projecrt
This is the repository for the Object Oriented Project, as required for CS F213.

This project is a basic prototype for a custom Laundry Machine management system, to be used in laundromats.

It has the following features:

- Login module : The program uses different login credentials for different users. 
- Washing Machine & Dryer Functions : The program has separate menus for activating different types of machines and also shows you the last activated machine with the mode of activation
- Tokens: The program uses the concept of a physical token to limit the washes of an individual.
